Neuro_Flow 21.5.17 (2021-05-17)
===============================

Features
--------

- Neuro Flow now uses the dedicated Platform API to store the flow database. The storage is still supported but will be removed in a few months.

- Added new expressions functions:
  - `values(dict_instance)`: get values of dictionary (similar to python's `dict_instance.values()`)
  - `str(any)`: convert any object to string
  - `replace(string, old, new)`: replace all occurrences of `old` in `string` with `new`.
  - `join(separator, array)`: concatenate array of strings inserting `separator` in between. ([#357](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/357))

- Added support of default volumes similar to default env: both in live and batch modes, you can
  specify them under `defaults` section:
  ```
  defaults:
    volumes:
      - storage:some/dir:/mnt/some/dir
      - storage:some/another/dir:/mnt/some/another/dir
  ```
  - In live mode such volumes will be added to all jobs.
  - In batch mode such volumes will be added to all tasks.

  Default volumes are not passed to actions (same as default env). ([#359](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/359))

- Added passing of global options (`-v`, `-q`, `--show-traceback`) to neuro cli and executor. ([#360](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/360))

- Added `--dry-run` flag for `neuro-flow run` that enables prints job command instead of running it. ([#362](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/362))

- Added support of tagging bakes.

  To tag a bake:
  ```
  neuro bake --tag tag1 --tag tag2 batch_name
  ```
  To retrieve bakes by tags:
  ```
  neuro bakes --tag tag1
  ``` ([#382](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/382))


Bugfixes
--------


- Fixed bug that led to crash in `neuro-flow inspect` when bake had cached task. ([#358](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/358))

- Support click 8.0 ([#407](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/407))

Neuro_Flow 21.4.5 (2021-04-05)
==============================

Features
--------


- Mark cached task in `neuro-flow inspect <bake>` as "cached" instead of "succeeded". ([#318](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/318))

- Auto create parent directories in "upload()" expression function. ([#319](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/319))

- Add bake_id tag to jobs started by bake inside neuro platform. ([#320](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/320))

- Add tags to remote executor jobs. The tags are: "project:project_id", "flow:flow_name", "bake:bake_id",
  "remote_executor". ([#321](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/321))

- Print name of the action in error about unexpected needs entry, for example:
  ```
  ERROR: Action 'ws:some_action' does not contain task 'wrong_task_name'
  ``` ([#323](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/323))

- Added printing of filename in expression evaluation errors. ([#324](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/324))

- Dropped `outputs.needs` in batch actions. Made all action task results available for calculation action needs.
  This avoids confusing behavior when action can succeed even when some of its tasks have failed. ([#325](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/325))

- Add support of empty list and dict (`[]` and `{}`) in expressions. ([#333](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/333))

- Added validation of tasks `needs` property. ([#334](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/334))

- Added validation of action arguments before starting a bake. ([#336](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/336))

- Implemented marking of bake as failed when an error happens during the batch execution. If the error is caused
  because of SIGINT, the bake will be marked as cancelled instead of failed. ([#338](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/338))

- Allow to specify timeout for executor job in yaml and increase default lifespan to 7d. Example:
  ```
  kind: batch
  life_span: 30d
  tasks:
    ...
  ``` ([#339](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/339))

- Add support of local actions inside of batch actions if they do not depend on any remote tasks. ([#340](https://github.com/neuro-inc/neuro-flow/issues/340))
